## Misc

### Generate Spacing file

You can run `sh ./create-sizing-scale.sh` in `/constants` to generate a file with a dynamic sizing scale based on a base size. The scale is from Tailwind v3.

## Troubleshooting

[//]: # (TODO: Structure the list. It is more or less thrown in without an order)

- Consult the docs
- Check the package version in package.json.
- If it's a UI issue: Is it related to a parent that is scrollable? Does the bug still happen when it is placed outside a scrollable parent?
